# TASK

## Background

We want to develop ticket-selling platform.

Front-end part of the application is not yet ready so feel free to design API
however you want.

### High level features

1. Get info about an event
2. Get info about about available tickets
3. Purchase ticket

### Feature requirements

*Get info about an event*

1. Event has a name
2. Event has date and time

*Get info about about available tickets*

1. We should be able receive information about what quantity
   of tickets is available.

*Pay for ticket*

1. For the sake of simplicity we operate only on `EUR` currency. Fee free to use provided
   adapter.

### Additional info

1. We really don't want to push you in any certain direction but if you've
   made certain assumptions how it should work with FE then please let us know.
   TL;DR - you can briefly describe how the whole app would interact.
2. Tests would be appreciated but are not required.
